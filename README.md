## Content
- Times - comparing time complexity of different versions of one algorithm
- Heapsort - recursive and iterative version
- Quicksort - small partitions are sorted using Insertion Sort
- Radix sort + Counting sort - sorting strings, comparing times with Quicksort
- Linked list - deleting duplicates, merging two lists
- Hash tables - inserting, searching, double hashing
- Binary search trees - inserting, searching, deleting
- Red black trees - inserting, searching, deleting, rotations, depths
- Longest common subquence - printing 1 sequence, iterative version
- Huffman code - encoding string from file, comparing lengths with original
- B-tree - inserting, searching, splitting nodes, nodes are saved in memory instead of disk
- Disjoint sets - MakeSet, FindSet, Union with ranks and path compression
